# Changelog

## v0.1.2 — 2026-10-05 (noise fixes from the first real audit)
- Skips browser profiles and caches (Chrome scoped_dir, WasmTtsEngine, Cache dirs) and package caches.
- Tighter OpenAI-style key pattern: `sk-SK-…` Slovak voice names were matching.
- New WT-S003: known CLI credential files (Claude Code, GitHub CLI, AWS, git, Docker, npm, gcloud) reported once each as high with least-privilege advice instead of "delete".
- Skills from managed and marketplace plugins are checked for malicious indicators only, not style.
- Score counts each risk once (plus up to 5 for repeats), so 300 skills with the same style issue don't outweigh one live secret.
- Report lists low findings as counts; new `wt.py breakdown` shows findings by rule and folder.

## v0.1.1 — 2026-10-05 (fitted to a real Grok Bot computer)
- Reads Grok Bot's own `~/agent-data/settings.json`: Auto Review rules and local-tool permission, no export needed.
- New WT-A004: an Allow-automatically rule that lets a Bot create automations, routines or installs is high risk.
- New WT-A005: no Auto Review rules at all.
- gitleaks always runs with `--redact` and its report is deleted after parsing, so Watchtower never writes plaintext secrets to the shared computer; findings grouped per file.
- Secrets scan: one finding per file with a count.
- SkillSpector: parses the real `issues[]` and `risk_assessment` schema (v2.12).
- `/vet-template`: public previews show only the description, so it uses the Download link.

## v0.1.0 — 2026-10
- `wt.py` with vet, audit, daily, report, baseline; stdlib only.
- 16 text rules mapped to OWASP ASI and AST, with context guards so warnings about attacks are not flagged as attacks.
- Routine, Auto Review and settings linters; integrity drift; persistence diff; secrets scan with masking.
- Optional SkillSpector, gitleaks and pip-audit integration.
- Four skills, two routines, the Bot description, pinned installer with manifest verification.
